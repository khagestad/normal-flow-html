        <p><em>The Data Visualization</em> is a visual, handmade recreation of the data we took at the beginning of the semester. It's got several marks and attributes that show each different type of data point I took. It turned out pretty well for being new to <em>Inkscape</em>.</p>

      <h2>Explained Video</h2>
      <section>
        <p><em>The Explained Video</em> is a group project that I worked on that explains healthcare algorithms and the issues surrounding the technology used to provide healthcare. The goal is to better understand how technology is taking over certain aspects of the healthcare industry, and possible solutions for those issues.</p>
